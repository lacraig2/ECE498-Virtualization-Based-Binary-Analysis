# KERNEL STACK EXAMPLES
## LAYOUT
Inside of [stacks.tar.gz](stacks.tar.gz) there exist 1001 examples of kernel stacks. They are 8KB and in the same form as [file_ffb](file_ffb). They are simple memory dumps, have no real identifying marks, and are not guaranteed to be unique.

The resulting [kernelinfo.conf](kernelinfo.conf) is also available.
